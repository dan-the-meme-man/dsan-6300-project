        <h2>Longest Delay by Airline (March '22)</h2>
        <p>
            This bar chart displays the longest delay experienced in March 2022 by across all flights operated by a given airline.
            For instance, the longest delay experienced by a Delta flight in March 2022 was 1,248 minutes.

        </p>
        <p>
            American had the longest delay of any airline in March 2022, with a delay of 2,966 minutes.
            At the other extreme, Horizon's longest delay was only 430 minutes.

        <h2>Most Ahead-of-Schedule Take-off by Airline (March '22)</h2>
        <p>
            This bar chart displays the most ahead-of-schedule take-off by airline in March 2022.
            For instance, the most ahead-of-schedule take-off by a JetBlue flight in March 2022 was a 56-minute early departure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alaska had the most ahead-of-schedule take-off of any airline in March 2022, with a 63-minute early departure.
            At the other extreme, Endeavor's most ahead-of-schedule take-off was only a 20-minute early departure.

        <h2>Number of Flights by Day of Week (March '22)</h2>
        <p>
            This bar chart displays the number of flights by day of the week in March 2022.
            For instance, there were 75,804 flights occurring on Mondays in March 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thursdays had the most flights in March 2022, with 95,655 flights.
            At the other extreme, Saturdays had the fewest flights, with 67,245 flights.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be noted that March 2022 had 5 each of Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, which may
            explain to some extent why those three days occupy the top three spots in terms of number of flights.

        <h2>Airport with the Longest Average Delay (Treating Early Departures as On-Time, March '22)</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Name: Valdosta, GA: Valdosta Regional</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Code: VLD</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Average Delay (minutes): ~67.8</p>
        <p>
            Valdosta, GA's regional airport had the longest average delay of any airport in March 2022, across
            all departing flights. The average delay for a flight leaving from VLD was approximately 67.8 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should be noted that airports were not "given credit" for early departures, which were treated as having a delay
            of 0 minutes, rather than a "negative delay." That is, early and on-time departures were treated identically.

        <h2>Airport with Longest Average Delay by Airline (March '22)<br><sup>Hover to see airport</sup></h2>
        <p>
            This bar chart displays the airport having the longest average delay for each airline in March 2022,
            considering all flights departing flights from that airport operated by that airline.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, considering only flights operated by Spirit, the airport with the longest average delay was
            the Akron-Canton area's regional airport (CAK). The average delay for a Spirit flight departing from CAK was
            about 45 minutes in March 2022, and no airport had a longer average delay for Spirit flights in March 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, airports were not "given credit" for early departures, which were treated as having a delay
            of 0 minutes, rather than a "negative delay." That is, early and on-time departures were treated identically.
        </p>
        <p>
            JetBlue had the longest average delay at a single airport of any airline in March 2022, with an average delay of
            about 200 minutes at the Hayden, CO airport. At the other extreme, Southwest's longest average delay at a single
            airport was only about 26 minutes, at Orlando International.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid making the visualization too dense, the airport name is displayed when hovering over the bar for the
            airline in question.

        <h2>Cancellations by Airport and Most Frequent Reason (Including Ties)</h2>
        <p>
            This bar chart displays the most frequent reason for cancellations at each airport in March 2022. The color and
            corresponding legend indicate the most frequent reason for cancellations at each airport, while the height indicates
            the number of cancellations at that airport for that reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, at LaGuardia, the most frequent reason for cancellation in March 2022 was "Weather", with 364
            cancellations. At Tampa International, the most frequent reason was "National Air System" (indicating for instance
            heavy traffic, tests or launches by NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, or some other issue affecting airspace around
            Tampa), with 57 cancellations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some bars are split cleanly in half, indicating that two reasons were tied for most frequent reason for
            cancellations at that airport.

    <h2>4-Day Moving Average of Number of Flights (March '22)</h2>
    <div class="iframe-container">
        <hr>
        <p>
            This line chart displays the 4-day moving average of the number of flights in March 2022. The moving average
            is calculated by taking the average of the number of flights on a given day and the three days preceding it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The x-axis represents the day of the month (i.e. Day 20 = March 20, 2022), while the y-axis represents the
            4-day moving average of the number of flights. For instance, the 4-day moving average of the number of flights
            on March 20, 2022 was about 18,701 flights, indicating that the average number of flights per day over the period
            March 17-20, 2022 was about 18,701.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a weak cyclic trend in the data, with a spike roughly once a week (ignoring the spike around day 4).
            The spikes occur around Sundays and Mondays (6-7, 13-14, 20-21, and 27-28), which may be due to increased daily flights
            on weekends. Though this conflicts with the earlier observation that Tuesdays-Thursdays had the most flights in March
            2022, it is still possible because again, there were more of those days in March 2022 than there were Mondays, Fridays,
            Saturdays, or Sundays.
